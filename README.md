# GRASS-GIS-Assistant_Model
This repository contains my first assistant model, developed using a Large Language Model (LLM), as a part of the final project for my LLM class. The purpose of this assistant is to guide users in identifying the appropriate GRASS GIS tools for their geospatial analysis tasks.
