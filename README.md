# GRASS-GIS-Assistant_Model
This repository contains my first assistant model, developed using a Large Language Model (LLM), as a part of the final project for my LLM class. The purpose of this assistant is to guide users in identifying the appropriate GRASS GIS tools for their geospatial analysis tasks.

# Overview
The GRASS GIS Assistant leverages the power of LLMs to answer user queries about geospatial operations by recommending the correct GRASS GIS tools. Whether you're working on raster analysis, vector processing, or hydrological modeling, this model provides accurate suggestions based on your input.

## Key Features:
Simple Query Handling: Users can input natural language queries, and the assistant will classify the task and suggest the appropriate GRASS GIS tool.
Tool Recommendations: Provide GRASS GIS commands, their descriptions, and links to the official documentation for further guidance.
LLM-Powered: Built using state-of-the-art language models for accurate and context-aware task classification.

## How It Works
User Query: Input your geospatial task as a question, e.g., "How do I create a buffer around vector features?".
Task Classification: The LLM processes the query and classifies it into a predefined geospatial task.
Tool Recommendation: The model suggests the most relevant GRASS GIS command, a brief description, and a link to the manual.

## Technologies Used
Large Language Models (LLMs): For query understanding and task classification.
Python: For backend implementation and integration with the GRASS GIS toolset.
GRASS GIS: A powerful open-source geospatial software for handling raster, vector, and imagery data.
Hugging Face Transformers: For leveraging pre-trained LLMs.
GRASS-Session: To interact programmatically with GRASS GIS from Python.
